Task:
Given the edges of a simple directed weighted graph with N nodes and M edges,
prepare the adjacency list representation of that graph.
The nodes are numbered from 1 to N.

Input:
First line contains the number of tests. The description of each test follows.
Each test is described by four lines. First line contains N and M. Second line
contains M integers U[i]. Third line contains M integers V[i]. Forth line
contains M integers W[i]. There is an edge from U[i] to V[i] with weight W[i].

Output:
For each test in the given order, print N lines representing the adjacency list
which you are asked to prepare in this task. The i'th line has "i:" followed by
some (x,y) pairs such that there is an edge from i to x with weight y.

Time limit: 1s (cpp) or 1.5s (java) or 3s (py) per batch.

Hints:
- Use fast input/output methods.
- 0.2 score for passing only sample batches.
- O(N^2) solution is expected.
