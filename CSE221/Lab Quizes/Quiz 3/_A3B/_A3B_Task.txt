Task:
Given a list of N integers A[i], count the number of pairs of positions (x, y)
such that x < y and A[x] > A[y]^2.

Input:
First line contains the number of tests. The description of each test follows.
Each test is described by two lines. First line contains N. Second line
contains the integers A[i].

Output:
For each test in the given order, print the number you are asked to find in
this task in one line.

Time limit: 1s (cpp) or 1.5s (java) or 3s (py) per batch.

Hints:
- Use fast input/output methods.
- 0.2 score for passing only sample batches.
- O(N*log(N)) solution is expected.
