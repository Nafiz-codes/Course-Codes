Task:
Given the edges of a tree with N nodes rooted at node R and Q queries X[i],
find the height of the subtree under node X[i] for each query.
The nodes are numbered from 1 to N.

Input:
First line contains the number of tests. The description of each test follows.
Each test is described by (N+Q+1) lines. First line contains N, R. Each of the
next (N-1) lines contains U[i] and V[i] indicating that there is an edge
between U[i] to V[i]. Next line contains Q. Each of the next Q lines contains
X[i].

Output:
For each test in the given order, print Q lines in the same order as the query
nodes X[i], containing the heights that you are asked to find in this task.

Time limit: 1s (cpp) or 1.5s (java) or 3s (py) per batch.

Hints:
- Use fast input/output methods.
- 0.2 score for passing only sample batches.
- O(N+Q) solution is expected.
